**Web Application Metadata Markup** is a structure that describes the characteristics of a given web application. When you want to accelerate the development of your application, it eliminates the need for generators, boilerplates, and SaaS templates. It represents a different approach to using AI to produce the code. Instead of prompting AI to generate the code, you prompt AI to create the structure, which later can be used by rendering engines to generate code that is always up to date, high quality, and without hallucinations.
